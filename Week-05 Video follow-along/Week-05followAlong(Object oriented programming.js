//Let's talk about object oriented programming.

//With ES6 new features were releasd which allows to write JS in a more object oriented manner.
//Object oriented programming is most commonly used methodology of how to write code.
//Objects have attributes, and functionality(things they can do).

//Let's look at a DVD player example.
/*

//Constructs called "Classes" are used to group code together in a logical way to represent objects.
